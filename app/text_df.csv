Additionally, the financial implications of fleet turnover or renewal, including depreciation and financing options, can be complex and difficult to navigate .",Technology,Organization
Other,"One often misunderstood aspect of fleet renewal is the total cost of ownership (TCO) over time. Many decision-makers focus heavily on upfront capital costs while undervaluing long-term savings from lower maintenance, fuel efficiency, or incentives linked to newer or alternative-fuel vehicles, especially EVs.

There’s also a knowledge gap around Regulation timelines and emissions compliance, particularly regarding the phasing out of older diesel vehicles or meeting regional zero-emission mandates. This can lead to delayed decisions and missed funding opportunities.

Operationally, the effect of vehicle downtime during the transition, such as infrastructure upgrades, training for EV use, or retrofits, is often underestimated. Teams may not fully plan for the behavioral shifts required from drivers, technicians, and dispatchers when new technologies are introduced.

Finally, in some organizations, fleet renewal is seen as a procurement task rather than a strategic operational investment. This perspective can hinder long-term optimization and sustainability goals.",Cost,Regulation

Fleet managers,"Total Cost of Ownership vs. Purchase Price

Most people still focus on the sticker price rather than the full lifecycle cost.

Poorly understood factors

Maintenance and downtime costs often exceed purchase price differences.

Fuel/energy costs across the vehicle’s lifetime are wildly underestimated.

Residual value (resale value) is rarely incorporated correctly.

Older vehicles cost more in unplanned downtime, but that cost is rarely tracked.

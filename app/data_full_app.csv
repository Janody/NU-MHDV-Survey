Throughout my career, i  have worked in various roles related to fleet operations and logistics, including managing a fleet of delivery vehicles for a large distribution company. My experience has given me a deep understanding of the importance of efficient routing, vehicle maintenance and compliance with transportation regulations. In  my current role, i use this knowledge to make informed decisions about fleet size , vehicle types, and operational strategies, ensuring that our fleet is both cost-effective and compliant with all relevant laws and regulations.",3.0,,,,,3.0,42.0,52.0,67.0,62.0,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,Rarely or Never,12.0,,1.0,,4.0,,No challenges,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,Not likey,Electric Vehicles ,Internal combustion engine vehicle ,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,none,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,none,"Aspects of fleet turnover or renewal that are not well understood include the impact of emerging technologies, such as electric vehicles and autonomous driving, on fleet management .

32,fb63d832,4,Data analyst,1.0,5.0,"My background as a Data Analyst includes experience in transportation and logistics. I have analyzed fleet performance metrics, optimized routes, improved fuel efficiency, managed maintenance schedules, and studied driver behavior using data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, as well as statistical programming languages such as Python, SQL, and Excel. 

In my previous roles, I worked closely with operations and fleet managers to create useful insights from telematics data, GPS tracking, and delivery logs. This collaboration helped reduce downtime and improve fleet efficiency. I also supported key performance indicators related to cost-per-mile, on-time delivery rates, and vehicle utilization. 

Although my formal education is in [e.g., Computer Science / Data Science / Business Analytics], I have completed specialized courses and certifications in supply chain analytics and transportation logistics, such as Coursera’s Supply Chain Management and MITx MicroMasters in SCM. 

This experience allows me to effectively interpret operational data, find inefficiencies, and make valuable contributions to fleet strategy and planning.",1.0,,,,,1.0,,15.0,25.0,40.0,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,,no,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,"Electric Vehicles (EVs): EVs are becoming increasingly viable for light- and medium-duty fleets, especially in urban logistics. Advances in battery range, charging infrastructure, and lower total cost of ownership make them highly promising for short-haul and last-mile applications.  Telematics and Predictive Maintenance: Integrated telematics systems using AI and IoT enable real-time vehicle health monitoring, route optimization, and driver behavior analysis—leading to reduced downtime and improved operational efficiency.  Fleet Management Software with Data Integration:","Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles: While promising for long-haul and heavy-duty applications, infrastructure is still lacking, and costs remain high—limiting near-term feasibility.  Autonomous Vehicles (AVs): Full autonomy is still years away from regulatory approval and safe deployment at scale. In the short term, semi-autonomous features (like lane assist and adaptive cruise control) are more realistic.",,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,"One often misunderstood aspect of fleet renewal is the total cost of ownership (TCO) over time. Many decision-makers focus heavily on upfront capital costs while undervaluing long-term savings from lower maintenance, fuel efficiency, or incentives linked to newer or alternative-fuel vehicles, especially EVs.

There’s also a knowledge gap around regulatory timelines and emissions compliance, particularly regarding the phasing out of older diesel vehicles or meeting regional zero-emission mandates. This can lead to delayed decisions and missed funding opportunities.

Operationally, the effect of vehicle downtime during the transition, such as infrastructure upgrades, training for EV use, or retrofits, is often underestimated. Teams may not fully plan for the behavioral shifts required from drivers, technicians, and dispatchers when new technologies are introduced.

Finally, in some organizations, fleet renewal is seen as a procurement task rather than a strategic operational investment. This perspective can hinder long-term optimization and sustainability goals.",no,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1,< 100 vehicles,,,,,,Other

Most people still focus on the sticker price rather than the full lifecycle cost.

Poorly understood factors

Maintenance and downtime costs often exceed purchase price differences.

Fuel/energy costs across the vehicle’s lifetime are wildly underestimated.

Residual value (resale value) is rarely incorporated correctly.

Older vehicles cost more in unplanned downtime, but that cost is rarely tracked.

Fleets keep old vehicles “because they’re paid off,” even though they are more expensive to operate than new ones.",Not that I can think of,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0.0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1,> 100 vehicles,,,,,,Fleet managers

When I can no longer keep it in good mechanical condition I will quit the trucking industry. The burden of government over regulation has made it nearly impossible to make a decent living as an owner operator ,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,30.0,,5.0,The last 2 trucks I purchased were new but I’ll never buy another due to excessive government regulation of small business truckers,3.0,3.0,Again I’d like to reiterate that over regulation of small business trucking has made it nearly impossible for me to operate my business and make a decent profit. Small business truckers have the same regulatory requirements as a fleet of 10000 trucks and we have no staff to do any of the compliance related work. ,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,The business of trucking is not enjoyable any longer due over regulation ,,,Over regulation of small business truckers has taken all enjoyment out of the business for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Over regulation of small business trucking is ignored. The ELD mandate has created the most stressful anxiety producing headache I have ever dealt with. There is no way in hell that it makes me more safe. As a matter of fact I am quite sure that many drivers are less safe because of the ELD mandate ,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,< 100 vehicles,1.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,Owner-Operators

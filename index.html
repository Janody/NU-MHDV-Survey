This collaboration helped reduce downtime and improve fleet efficiency. I also supported key performance indicators related to cost-per-mile, on-time delivery rates, and vehicle utilization.

Many decision-makers focus heavily on upfront capital costs while undervaluing long-term savings from lower maintenance, fuel efficiency, or incentives linked to newer or alternative-fuel vehicles, especially EVs.

There’s also a knowledge gap around regulatory timelines and emissions compliance, particularly regarding the phasing out of older diesel vehicles or meeting regional zero-emission mandates. This can lead to delayed decisions and missed funding opportunities.

Operationally, the effect of vehicle downtime during the transition, such as infrastructure upgrades, training for EV use, or retrofits, is often underestimated. Teams may not fully plan for the behavioral shifts required from drivers, technicians, and dispatchers when new technologies are introduced.

Finally, in some organizations, fleet renewal is seen as a procurement task rather than a strategic operational investment.

Most people still focus on the sticker price rather than the full lifecycle cost.

Poorly understood factors

Maintenance and downtime costs often exceed purchase price differences.

Fuel/energy costs across the vehicle’s lifetime are wildly underestimated.

Residual value (resale value) is rarely incorporated correctly.

Older vehicles cost more in unplanned downtime, but that cost is rarely tracked.

Fleets keep old vehicles “because they’re paid off,” even though they are more expensive to operate than new ones.",Not that I can think of,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0.0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1,> 100 vehicles,,,,,,Fleet managers

On average, the majority of vehicles in fleets of 100 vehicles and more are of **Class 6 and higher** (53%). This percentage drops to *18%* for smaller fleets (less than 100 vehicles in the fleet). On average, almost half of the vehicles in larger fleets are used for **urban logistics** (23% for smaller fleets).

For owner-operators, the majority owns a Class 6 or higher vehicle (57%), and about a third own a vehicle with a pre-2010 engine.

# Fleet managers and owner-operators survey 

This dashboard summarizes results from a **national survey of U.S. medium- and heavy-duty vehicle (MHDV) operators** conducted by the Mobility and Transport Laboratory at Northwestern University. The goal of the study is to understand **how fleets make decisions** about replacing older trucks, what **tools and constraints** influence these decisions, and how companies, large and small, view **future options** available to them.
We reached both **fleet managers** and **owner-operators** to reflect the full range of business models, operating environments, and vehicle use cases across the industry.

## What the survey covers

The survey focuses on practical, day-to-day decision-making around fleet turnover. Topics include:

- How companies manage vehicle age, replacement cycles, and operational needs
- What tools or data they rely on when deciding to retire or replace a truck
- Willingness to consider different technology options, from newer diesel models to low- and zero-emission vehicles
- Views on regulations, incentives, and other external pressures influencing turnover decisions

## Survey recruitment 

Recruitment focused on achieving strong representation across fleet sizes, operating models, vehicle classes, and geographic regions. We partnered with industry associations, including NACFE, ITA, M-WTA, IAC, and OOIDA, to reach both carriers and independent owner-operators.

## Collaborators
- **Amanda Stathopolous**, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering
- **Bret Johnson**, Transportation Center
- **Janody Pougala**, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering,
- **Deirdre Edward**, Department of Engineering Science and Applied Mathematics

We invited respondents' insights on the outlook for these newer technologies in their organizations and in the broader industry, including adoption likelihood and ranking of available decision support systems. We consider 10 specific technologies: 
- New Internal Combustion Engines (ICE), 
- Hybrid vehicles, 
- Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV), 
- Hydrogen Fuel Cell  (HFC) vehicles, 
- Smart management tools (non-A.I.),
- A.I tools, 
- Optimization and logistics innovations.

There’s also a knowledge gap around Regulation timelines and emissions compliance, particularly regarding the phasing out of older diesel vehicles or meeting regional zero-emission mandates. This can lead to delayed decisions and missed funding opportunities.

Operationally, the effect of vehicle downtime during the transition, such as infrastructure upgrades, training for EV use, or retrofits, is often underestimated.
